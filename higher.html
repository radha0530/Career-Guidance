   <p>Engineering is amongst the choicest degree courses after 12th Science which has been continuously entangled with innovative technology. Pursuing an engineering degree is quite an arduous task as it combines a diverse range of knowledge into generally a four-year degree. Kudos to having completed ‚Äú40 subjects with 4,000 experiments attending 40,000 lectures in 4 years.‚Äù The feeling of accomplishment is euphoric, but it doesn‚Äôt end here. Assuming that there are students out there, who were pressurized into engineering or those who have their every move planned, this point can be important as you have a chance to write the rest of the pages of your professional career. So here to help you is a list of courses <strong>after engineering that you must consider.</strong> </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Master of Science (M.Sc. or M.S.)</h2>
      <img src="msc.png" alt="career" height="250" width="400"><br> 
        <p>A natural and a well-chosen option, students mostly prefer doing Master of Science in their choice of specialisation, after their engineering. Students who have a preference for the technical aspects of things, opt for this course. The advantage in doing an M.S. is that other courses require certain years of work experience but there is no such requirement for doing an M.S. Doing your M.S. from abroad might speed up your chances to get a job outside the country. Getting a good score on your GRE, a good LOR and SOP should get you through to your dream college.<br> Some of the key specialisations for MSc degrees are:</p>
        </div><br>
        <div class="ul">
        <ul><strong>
       <li> MSc Physics</li>
       <li>MSc Chemistry</li>
        <li>MS in Artificial Intelligence</li>
          <li>MSc in Computer Science</li>
            <li>M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and Computing</li>
              <li>M.Sc. in Electronic Science</li>
                <li>M.Sc. in Electronic Science</li>

      <p>A gradual transition from BTech.,<b> MTech is another option that engineering students</b> explore as a course to do after engineering. Masters in Technology focuses deeply on the subjects taught during the under-graduation period. Students take up streams in which they have pursued their B. Tech to get a well-paying job in their desired field. The GATE examination is a must to get through to college offering an M.Tech degree. An MTech degree is achievable while doing a job too.<br>Take a look at the following specialisations you can opt for top MTech Courses:</p>

      <p>Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) offers a diploma in management as opposed to an MBA that provides a degree in the same. Even though they considered similar to each other, the syllabus differs for both the programs. While the MBA syllabus is more university pacifying, while this is not the case of PGDM. For most of the colleges, PGDM is more slanted towards industry-based learning, versus MBA that has a more theoretical approach.<br> Another good and rewarding course to consider after engineering.</p>
